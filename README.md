# wikipedia-bot
A wikipedia bot that plays the "Links to Philosophy" game (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy). Almost every article in the English-language wikipedia will eventually point to the article for Philosophy if you click the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link. This bot crawls through this path for any input, if the input can be associated with an article.
